# AI-Image-Classifier
This project is a machine learning model that classifies images of animals using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model was trained using the popular TensorFlow and Keras libraries, and it can classify images into categories like cats, dogs, and horses.

# Features
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for image classification.
Trained on a labeled dataset of animal images.
Uses data augmentation to improve model accuracy and prevent overfitting.
Outputs the predicted class for any input image.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains labeled images of various animals such as cats, dogs, and horses. If you want to replicate the results, you can use public datasets like:
Kaggle Cats vs. Dogs
Custom datasets can also be used by following the instructions below.

# Technologies Used
Python: Primary language for building and training the model.
TensorFlow & Keras: Libraries used to implement and train the CNN model.
OpenCV: Used for image preprocessing tasks.
NumPy & Pandas: For data manipulation.
Matplotlib: For visualizing results and performance metrics.

# Model Architecture
The image classifier uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following architecture:
Input Layer: Image input, resized to 128x128 pixels.
Convolutional Layers: Multiple layers of convolution and max-pooling to detect image features.
Fully Connected Layers: Dense layers to interpret and classify the features.
Output Layer: Softmax activation for multi-class classification.

# How to Use
# 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Image-Classifier.git
cd AI-Image-Classifier
# 2. Install Dependencies
You can install the required Python libraries using pip. The dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file.
pip install -r requirements.txt
# 3. Train the Model
To train the model on your own dataset:

# Run the training script:
python train_model.py

# 4. Test the Model
After training, you can test the model by running the test_model.py script:
python test_model.py --image_path 'path_to_your_image.jpg'
Replace 'path_to_your_image.jpg' with the path to the image you want to classify.

# 5. Pretrained Model
If you want to use the pretrained model without retraining, you can download the pre-trained weights from the models/ directory and use them with the predict.py script.

# 6. Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can visualize the training and validation curves using Matplotlib.

# Results
After training the model for several epochs, the classifier achieves an accuracy of approximately 90% on the validation set. The confusion matrix and other evaluation metrics are visualized below:

# Future Work
Improve model accuracy with more data and advanced architectures.
Experiment with Transfer Learning using pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG16.
Add more image categories and datasets.
